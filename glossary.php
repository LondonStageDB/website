                    <p>Users less familiar with English theater of the long eighteenth century (1660-1800) may run
                        across a few unfamiliar words in using the site. Here is a brief glossary of some of the most
                        frequently used terms:</p>

                    <h3 id='mainpiece' font-size="1rem">Mainpiece</h3>
                    <p>The main play, usually five acts long, that was given top billing for an evening at the
                        theater. It was often followed by at least one <a
                                href='/glossary.php#afterpiece'>afterpiece</a>, and
                        interspersed with a variety of musical pieces, dances, monologues, and/or <a

                        between the acts.</p>
                    <h3 id='afterpiece'>Afterpiece</h3>
                    <p>A shorter (often one- or two-act) dramatic piece meant to be performed after the <a
                                href='/glossary.php#mainpiece'>mainpiece</a>; usually comical or farcical in nature.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id='entertainment'>Entertainment</h3>
                    <p>An interlude or other performance piece that might feature in an evening at the theater.
                        Popular forms of entertainment throughout the century included not only singing, dancing,
                        and musical performances, but also acrobatics, imitations or impersonations, and acts
                        featuring trained animals.</p>
                    <h3 id='pantomime'>Pantomime</h3>
                    <p>An English form of performance, sometimes referred to as "Harlequinade," that was adapted
                        from the Italian <i>commedia dell'arte</i> tradition and featured stock characters like
                        Harlequin, Columbine, Scaramouche, and Pantaloon. These performances incorporated dance,
                        gesture, slapstick physical comedy, elaborate scenery, and special effects.</p>
                    <h3 id='prologue-epilogue'>Prologue/Epilogue</h3>
                    <p>A short framing piece, usually in poetic verse, that preceded (prologue) or followed
                        (epilogue) the <a
                                href='/glossary.php#mainpiece'>mainpiece</a>. These pieces could be performed by
                        actors from the play either in character or as themselves, or by other conventional stage
                        figures. Some were written as companion pieces for specific plays, while others were more
                        general and could accompany a variety of plays. Prologues and epilogues alike were most
                        commonly spoken on the first few nights of a new play's run and attempted to win the
                        audience's support and applause for the new offering.

                    <h2>Theatrical Culture</h2>
                    <h3 id='benefit'>Benefit</h3>
                    <p>A performance for which the profits would be assigned to a specific actor, playwright, or
                        charitable cause. Playwrights' benefits typically took place every third night of the first
                        run of a new play; a play that lasted six or nine consecutive nights was considered
                        successful. Star actors' contracts usually included the right to one or more benefit nights,
                        usually in the spring, which made up a significant portion of their earnings for the
                        year.</p>
                    <h3 id='repertory'>Repertory</h3>
                    <p>During this period, the major London playhouses were repertory theaters. This means that they
                        had a "stock" of dozens of plays that they performed in rotation throughout a theatrical <a
                                href='/glossary.php#season'>season</a>. The repertory system required that
                        actors have their parts for numerous scripts memorized and ready to go on short notice.</p>
                    <h3 id='season'>Season</h3>
                    <p>At this time, the London theaters operated on a seasonal basis, closing during the summer
                        months when many well-off Londoners left the city for vacation. Companies usually began the
                        performance season in late summer or early fall and continued through the spring of the
                        following year, although different theaters might begin and end their seasons on different
                        dates. Importantly, certain kinds of performance (especially puppet shows) continued at the
                        summer fairs, and the companies might also use the summer months to train up young
                        actors.</p>
                    <h3 id='accountbooks'>Account Books</h3>
                    <p>In addition to information from printed advertisements for plays and from playgoers' diaries,
                        the editors of <i>The London Stage, 1660-1800</i> rely on the financial records kept by the
                        treasurers at the major theaters. Where available, total box office receipts for an evening
                        are often listed in pounds, shillings, and pence (e.g. £57 14s. 6d.) in the "Comment" for an
                        event. For entries from Part 5 (1776-1800), additional numbers sometimes follow in
                        parentheses, breaking down the total revenue into income from different types of tickets:
                        "First Account" tickets sold to people who were in the house at the rise of the curtain;
                        "Half Price" or "Second Account" tickets sold at reduced prices for admission after the
                        conclusion of the third act; and "After-Money," income from late-comers after the First and
                        Second Accounts for the evening had already been entered. For entries taken from Part 5,
                        events at Drury Lane list the total receipts first, followed by these three categories; in
                        the same volume, for events at Covent Garden, the total receipts are listed first, followed
                        by the sum of First Account and Half Price tickets, followed by the After-Money. So, for
                        example, if the comment for a performance at Drury Lane reads "Receipts £174 7s. 6d.
                        (132/8/0; 36/2/6; 5/17/0)," it means that the theater took in £132 8s. for full-price
                        admissions to the entire evening's entertainment, £36 2s. 6d. for half-price tickets
                        to everything after the third act of the <a href='/glossary.php#mainpiece'>mainpiece</a>,
                        and £5 17s. in reduced-price tickets for very late admissions to the show.</p>

                        <p>The return of the monarch Charles II to the English throne in 1660 following the English
                            civil wars. The Restoration is considered an important event in English theatrical
                            history because King Charles reopened the public theaters in London, which had been
                            closed since 1642, and decreed that women could now perform on the public stage—a
                            practice that previously had been forbidden in England.
