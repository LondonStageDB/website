            <p>The London Stage Database is an example of a successful digital humanities project serving a broad
                audience within and beyond academe. The resulting website has logged upwards of 130,000 page views from
                more than 13,500 unique visitors. Hailed by peer reviewers as <a
                        href="https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/abo/vol10/iss2/3/">field-changing</a>, it has become a
                resource of central importance to theater and performance historians, librarians, and archivists. Beyond
                academe, LSDB has made its way into magazines for data scientists and communicators, family
                genealogists, and the international business community. Visit the links below to hear from some of these
