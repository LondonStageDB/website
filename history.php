                    <p>In the middle of the twentieth century, a team of theater historians created a calendar of
                        performances based on playbills and newspaper notices used to advertise performances,
                        as well as theater reviews, published gossip, playhouse records, and the diaries of people who
                        lived at the time. The result was <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000200105">
                            <i>The London Stage, 1660-1800: A Calendar of Plays, Entertainments & Afterpieces, Together
                                with Casts, Box-Receipts and Contemporary Comment. Compiled from the Playbills,
                                Newspapers
                                and Theatrical Diaries of the Period</i> (Southern Illinois University Press, 1960-1968)</a>.
                        This 8,000-page, eleven-book reference work was understood immediately as essential to
                        scholarly research and teaching about the period. It was also frustratingly difficult to use for
                        any kind of systematic inquiry.</p>

                    <p>In the 1970s, the editors of <i>The London Stage</i>
                        commissioned a computerized database of the information in their reference book. The <i>London
                            Stage Information Bank</i>, as it was then known, was created over the course of a
                        decade with the support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council
                        of
                        Learned Societies, the American Philosophical Society, the Andrew Mellon Foundation,
                        the Billy Rose Foundation, and others. Regrettably, it fell into technological obsolescence
                        after only a few years, and it was long thought irretrievably lost. The only surviving
                        artifact of the project that remained in circulation was the <a
                                href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000299859"><i>Index to the London

                        which was shelved alongside the original reference books in many research libraries.</p>

                    <p>In 2013, Mattie Burkert began investigating the history of the <i>Information Bank</i>,
                        drawing
                        on the archives at Lawrence University, where the original project was housed.
                        She also got in touch with the people involved in the <i>Information Bank</i> project,
                        including
                        developers and research assistants who had helped to build it. The story she uncovered,
                        and the origins of her efforts to recover the lost database, are detailed in the essay <a

                    <p>In 2020, Burkert moved to the University of Oregon and worked with developers there to
                        migrate
                        the site to UO servers; the following spring, the team launched a major update with
                        improvements
                        to the security and efficiency of the site, with a particular focus on the speed and

                    <p>These open access and open source values distinguish the <i>London Stage Database</i> from
                        related resources, such as the subscription-based <i>Eighteenth-Century Drama</i>
                        portal developed by publisher Adam Matthew. Furthermore, the media archaeological nature of
                        our
                        project informs our team's commitment to transparency about our sources, our decisions,
                        and the limitations of our work. Like any resource of its kind, the <i>London Stage
                            Database</i>
                        offers a useful starting point for research and teaching, but the data should not
                        be taken as a full, complete, or accurate picture of performance in London over a 140-year
                        period. Instead, we insist that it be understood as a representation of a particular
                        set of archival documents, transformed many times over by collectors of theater ephemera,
                        archivists, curators, editors, scholars, and developers.</p>
