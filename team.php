                        modern theories of memory, sympathy, and identity. Vareschi brings to the board expertise both
                        in the practical uses and theoretical problems of data-driven approaches to the study of
                        theatrical and print cultures, particularly in how digital resources tend to reinscribe
                        authorial attribution with vexed histories.</p>
