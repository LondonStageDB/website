        <p>For the sake of concision, the editors of <i>The London Stage, 1660-1800</i> used what they called a "ladder" system to abbreviate cast lists, which were often the lengthiest part of a performance entry. If the cast listed in the playbills and newspaper advertisements for a particular play stays fairly consistent over the course of a season, it is reproduced in full the first time it appears with that cast, and subsequent performances of the same play by the same company record the cast following the syntax "As [date], but [substitutions, if any]." So, for example, a performance of <i>The Busy Body</i> at Drury Lane on 31 May 1739 is recorded "THE BUSY BODY. As 28 Dec. 1738, but Whisper-Winstone." The user of the reference book can then turn to the entry for <i>The Busy Body</i> at Drury Lane on 28 December 1738 and read the cast list for that date: "As 23 Sept., but Marplot-Macklin; Whisper-Woodward." Turning back to September, the reader finds a full cast list: "Marplot-Cibber; Sir George-Mills; Sir Francis-Griffin; Miranda-Mrs Clive; Sir Jealous-Turbutt; Charles-Wright; Whisper-Macklin; Isabinda-Mrs Mills; Patch-Mrs Pritchard; Scentwell-Mrs Bennet." Making the appropriate substitutions, the reader can infer that the cast list advertised for the December performance was "<b>Marplot-Macklin</b>; Sir George-Mills; Sir Francis-Griffin; Miranda-Mrs Clive; Sir Jealous-Turbutt; Charles-Wright; <b>Whisper-Woodward</b>; Isabinda-Mrs Mills; Patch-Mrs Pritchard; Scentwell-Mrs Bennet," and that for the May performance it was "Marplot-Macklin; Sir George - Mills; Sir Francis - Griffin; Miranda - Mrs Clive; Sir Jealous - Turbutt; Charles - Wright; <b>Whisper-Winstone</b>; Isabinda - Mrs Mills; Patch - Mrs Pritchard; Scentwell - Mrs Bennet." Tracing these ladder cast lists without the aid of a database can be painstaking work if several substitutions are made over a series of performances.</p>
            <p>The <i>London Stage Database</i> attempts to reconstruct the cast list wherever the "as [date]" syntax occurs for a <b>mainpiece</b> or <b>afterpiece</b>. However, it ignores entries that follow other patterns. For example, the editors sometimes provide notes about an advertised cast list (or the lack thereof) and direct readers to "see [date]." This is an invitation to comparison; it represents the editors' conjecture that these two dates' cast lists bear some kind of relation. It does not, however, consistently represent a correspondence between advertised casts in the same way that the "as [date]" syntax does, so we have chosen not to attempt cast lists for these "see [date]" entries.</p>
            <p>Note that the program that reconstructs "as [date]" cast lists ignores the roles of <b>Prologue</b> and <b>Epilogue</b>. Because these short pieces were often occasional and might only be spoken at initial performances of a play (or as reflections on special events, like an author or actor <b>benefit</b>), they are not assumed to carry forward through subsequent performances in the same way that other roles do.</p>
